# opsec-tools
A bunch of security and pentesting tools written in python for fun.
This repo is uploaded as is, and some tools are unfinished. I'm uploading this mostly for backup
but if you desire, you can use this code however you like, no credit needed. In fact, if you're using this code, I'd rather not have my name tied to it.
